This is the first course of the specialization. 
This course talks about how to build, train and apply fully connected 
deep neural networks - Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks. Understand the key parameters in a 
neural network's architecture.This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only 
a cursory or surface-level description.

Below are the overview of projects as part of this course.

#### To clearly understand what's happening underhood all projects in this course are written using numpy and pandas. Tensorflow or keras are not used.

* [Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera/tree/master/Neural%20networks%20and%20Deep%20learning/Neural%20network%20basics) - Build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. This assignment will step through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone our intuitions about deep learning.
* [Planar data classification with one hidden layer](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera/tree/master/Neural%20networks%20and%20Deep%20learning/Shallow%20neural%20networks) - Build one layer NN.
* [Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera/blob/master/Neural%20networks%20and%20Deep%20learning/Deep%20neural%20networks/Building%2Byour%2BDeep%2BNeural%2BNetwork%2B-%2BStep%2Bby%2BStep%2Bv3.ipynb) - Here we will build a deep neural network, with as many layers as we want. In this project, implemented all the functions required to build a deep neural network using numpy.
* [Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application](https://github.com/raviteja-ganta/Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera/blob/master/Neural%20networks%20and%20Deep%20learning/Deep%20neural%20networks/Deep%2BNeural%2BNetwork%2B-%2BApplication%2Bv8.ipynb) - Used the functions I implemented in the previous assignment to build a deep network, and apply it to cat vs non-cat classification.
